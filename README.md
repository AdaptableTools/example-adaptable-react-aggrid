AdapTable React is the React Framework version of AdapTable - the market-leading, low code AG Grid extension.

## AdapTable React Custom Components

The main benefit of using AdapTable React is that it allows you to supply [custom components](https://www.adaptabletools.com/docs/react-custom-components) in AdapTable in a React-friendly way.

This demo showcases 3 React-specific features of AdapTable:

### Settings Panel

The demo illustrates how to pass custom React components to the [Settings Panel](https://www.adaptabletools.com/docs/ui-settings-panel):

```ts
const adaptableOptions: AdaptableOptions = {
    // ...
    settingsPanelOptions: {
        customSettingsPanels: [
            {
                // CUSTOM SETTINGS PANEL COMPONENT
                frameworkComponent: CustomSettingsPanel,
                name: 'Custom Settings',
            }
        ]
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Tool Panel

The demo illustrates how to pass custom React components to the [Tool Panel](https://www.adaptabletools.com/docs/ui-tool-panel):

```tsx
const adaptableOptions: AdaptableOptions = {
    // ...
    toolPanelOptions: {
        toolPanelOrder: ['adaptable', 'columns', 'filters'],
        customToolPanels: [
            {
                // CUSTOM TOOLPANEL COMPONENT
                // wraps a reusable React component (same component is used in a custom toolbar)
                name: 'CustomQuickSearch',
                title: 'Custom Quick Search',
                frameworkComponent: ({ adaptableApi }) => {
                    return (
                        <QuickSearchCustomComponent
                            onSearchTextChange={(searchText: string) => {
                        adaptableApi.quickSearchApi.runQuickSearch(searchText);
                    }}
                    />
                );
                },
            }]
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Custom Toolbar
The demo illustrates how to pass custom React components to the [Dashboard Toolbar](https://www.adaptabletools.com/docs/ui-dashboard):

```tsx
const adaptableOptions: AdaptableOptions = {
    // ...
    dashboardOptions: {
        customToolbars: [
            {
                // CUSTOM TOOLBAR COMPONENT
                // wraps a reusable React component (same component is used in a custom tool panel)
                name: 'CustomQuickSearch',
                title: 'Custom Quick Search',
                frameworkComponent: ({ adaptableApi }) => {
                    return (
                        <QuickSearchCustomComponent
                            onSearchTextChange={(searchText: string) => {
                                adaptableApi.quickSearchApi.runQuickSearch(searchText);
                            }}
                        />
                    );
                },
            },
        ],
